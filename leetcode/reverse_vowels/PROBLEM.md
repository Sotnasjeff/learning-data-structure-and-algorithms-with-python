## Problem Description
Given a string `s`, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`. They can appear in both lower and upper cases, and may occur more than once.

s = "IceCreAm"
```
**Output:**
```
"AceCreIm"
```
**Explanation:**
- The vowels in `s` are `['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']`.
- After reversing the vowels, `s` becomes `"AceCreIm"`.
